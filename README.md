Text Classification and Analysis on Persian Comments
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning classification for Persian text data. The workflow includes cleaning raw comments, generating word clouds, training machine learning models, and evaluating results.

The main objective is to demonstrate how preprocessing and feature engineering affect the quality of text classification models.

⚙️ Features Implemented

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removing punctuation, digits, and stopwords

Normalizing Persian text

Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Word cloud for all comments

Word cloud for misclassified samples

Distribution of labels

Machine Learning Models

TF-IDF vectorization

Training a baseline classification model (Logistic Regression / SVM)

Evaluation with classification report & confusion matrix

Visualization

Heatmaps of confusion matrix

Bar plots of label distributions

Word clouds for frequent tokens

📊 Sample Results
1. Word Cloud of Frequent Words

(Generated using WordCloud library)

2. Confusion Matrix Example
           precision    recall  f1-score   support
label_0       0.82      0.85      0.83       200
label_1       0.78      0.74      0.76       180

3. Label Distribution

Visualized using bar charts to show class balance.
